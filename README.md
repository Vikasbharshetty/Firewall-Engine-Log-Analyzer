# 🛡️ Sentinel Firewall Engine & Log Analyzer

A high-fidelity simulator for firewall rule management and security threat analysis. This project features a robust Python backend and a premium React-based dashboard designed to help developers and security enthusiasts understand network traffic filtering and threat detection.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔥 Real-time Firewall Simulation**: Add, remove, and manage firewall rules dynamically. Supports specific IPs, any-source rules, and CIDR notation (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`).
- **📊 Traffic Simulator**: Manually inject packets into the system to test rule configurations and see instant "ALLOW" or "DENY" decisions.
- **🛡️ Threat Detection**: Built-in security analyzer that monitors logs for patterns like **Brute Force Attacks** (automatically flags IPs with more than 5 blocked attempts).
- **📜 Live Activity Logs**: A scrollable dashboard showing real-time timestamps, source IPs, ports, protocols, and firewall actions.
- **📄 Security Incident Reports**: Generate and export structured security reports in JSON format for external auditing.
- **💎 Premium Dashboard**: A glassmorphic, dark-themed UI built with React, TypeScript, and Lucide icons.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3, FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Axios, Lucide-React
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Custom Glassmorphism Design System)
- **Data Persistence**: JSON (Rules), CSV/Text (Logs)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js & npm

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the project** to your local machine.
2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
   ```
3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend API**:
   ```bash
   # From the project root
   python app.py
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. You can view the automated documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

2. **Start the Frontend Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📖 Usage Guide

- **Testing a Rule**: Add a rule to `DENY` port `23`. Then, use the Traffic Simulator to send a packet to `src_ip: 192.168.1.100` and `port: 23`.
- **Triggering a Threat Alert**: Send 6 packets to a blocked port from the same IP. Watch the "Security Threats" panel light up with a "Brute Force Attempt" alert.
- **Exporting Data**: Click "Export Report" in the top right to download the current security status and detected threat details.
